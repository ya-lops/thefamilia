  <Section id="about" title="Marco DiMarco <mark>story</mark>">
    <p>
      Marco DiMarco is a young and ambitious gangster who grew up in the poor
      neighborhoods of Los Santos. Since childhood, he was surrounded by
      violence and crime, which influenced his character and worldview. Marco
      quickly realized that the only way to survive in this world was to become
      strong and cruel.
    </p>

    <p>
      In his youth, he began boxing to become stronger and more confident. But
      his talent and ambitions were not limited to sports. Marco dreamed of
      power and wealth, and he knew that the only way to achieve this was to
      become part of the criminal world.
    </p>

    <p>
      He soon joined one of the local gangs and began his career as a gangster.
      He quickly established himself as a brutal and ruthless fighter, ready to
      do anything for his gang. Marco became known for his daring robberies,
      bloody showdowns and merciless murders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today Marco DiMarco is one of the most powerful gangsters in Los Santos.
      He controls most of the city and has many enemies and allies. But despite
      all his achievements, Marco does not stop there and continues to strive
      for more. He is always ready for new challenges and is ready to risk
      everything for his goal - to become the most powerful gangster
